MOTION_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a motion analysis expert and choreography director specializing in AI video generation.
Analyze this 5-second video of a person performing a movement.

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:
{
  "movement_summary": "1-2 sentence description of the overall movement",
  "body_parts": ["list", "of", "body", "parts", "actively", "moving"],
  "phases": [
    {
      "time_range": "0:00-0:02",
      "action": "precise description of what each body part is doing",
      "tempo": "slow|medium|fast",
      "energy": "low|medium|high"
    }
  ],
  "camera_angle": "e.g. front-facing, medium shot",
  "overall_style": "e.g. fluid, sharp, rhythmic, robotic, graceful",
  "best_frame_timestamp": "e.g. 0:02",
  "person_description": "brief appearance description",
  "veo_prompt": "..."
}

For the veo_prompt field, write a detailed choreography-style prompt for an AI video model.
It must describe ONLY the movement — not the person's appearance. Include:
- Which body parts move and in what direction (up/down/left/right/forward/back, rotational)
- The sequence and timing (e.g. "from 0-2s the arms raise outward to shoulder height, then 2-4s the torso rotates left while the right arm sweeps across")
- The spatial range of each motion (small/large, tight/extended)
- Transitions between phases (sharp cut, smooth flow, bounce)
- Rhythm and energy arc (builds up, stays constant, slows down)
- Any characteristic motion qualities (sharp snap, fluid wave, staccato pulse)

The veo_prompt should be 2-4 sentences, precise enough that an animator could recreate the movement without watching the original video.
